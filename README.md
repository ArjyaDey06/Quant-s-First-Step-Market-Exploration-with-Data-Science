# 1. What are Financial Markets?
Financial markets are platforms where people buy and sell financial assets, like stocks, bonds, currencies, and commodities. They connect investors who have money with companies or governments that need funds, ensuring the economy runs smoothly.

Real-Life Analogy: Think of it like Amazon for money:

Companies list their “products” (stocks, bonds, etc.).

Investors “shop” by buying them.

Prices fluctuate based on demand and supply.

##  Key Terms
A) Stocks (Equities): 

 - Represents ownership in a company. When you buy a share, you become a part-owner. Your profit comes from dividends or when the stock price goes up.
   
 **Example:**
- Buying **1 share of TCS** → you now own a small part of TCS.
- If TCS does well and the stock rises from ₹3,000 to ₹3,300, you earn ₹300.
  
B)Bonds: 
 - Like loans you give to governments or companies. They promise to pay you back later with interest. Bonds are less risky than stocks but also offer lower returns.
   
**Example:**

- The Indian government issues **Government Bonds** to fund infrastructure projects.
- If you buy a ₹10,000 bond with a 7% annual interest rate, you’ll earn ₹700 each year.


C)Derivatives:
-A financial instrument whose value is derived from another asset (e.g., a stock). They are often used for managing risks or speculating.

**Example:**
- A farmer uses a **wheat futures contract** to lock in a price for their crop today so they won’t be hurt if prices fall in the future.
- Stock traders use **options** to bet on whether Reliance’s stock will go up or down.


D)Forex (Foreign Exchange Market): The global marketplace for buying and selling currencies. It is the largest financial market in the world.

**Example:**

- You travel to the U.S. and convert **₹84,000 to $1,000**.
- If the USD/INR exchange rate changes from 84 to 86, you gain or lose money based on timing.


# a) Daily Returns

Where:

- Pt = today’s closing price
- Pt−1 = previous day's closing price
- Rt = return for the day

**Why**: Measures how much a stock increased or decreased in one day — the foundation for all quant calculations.
